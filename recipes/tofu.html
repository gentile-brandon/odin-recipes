    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>General Tso's chicken was one of my favorite dishes before I became a vegetarian so finding an alternative was very important to me. This recipe utilizes fresh ingredients and an Air Fryer to ensure, delicious, crispy, restaurant style tofu right from the comfort of your own kitchen!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>For the Tofu</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>16 ounces extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Sesame Oil</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp Cayenne Pepper</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp Cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>For the garlic, ginger, and spices</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 Tbsp Sesame Oil</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp Minced Ginger</li>
          <li>1 tsp Crushed Garlic</li>
          <li>1/4 tsp Red Chili Flakes</li>
        </ul> 
      <h3>For the Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 Tbsp Rice Vinegar</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp Sesame Oil</li>
          <li>2 Tbsp Soy Sauce</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp Hoisin Sauce</li>
          <li>1 tsp Onion Powder</li>
          <li>2 Tbsp Sugar</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp Cornstarch</li>
          <li>1/4 cup vegetable stock</li>
        </ul> 
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the tofu in a tofu press OR place the tofu on a plate with another plate on top with something heavy on top. Leave for <strong>at least</strong> 30 mins</li>
        <li>While the tofu is pressing, you can prepare the sauce by mixing all the listed ingredients together.</li>
        <li>When the tofu is pressed, cut into cubes and place it into a container with lid. Add sesame oil, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper to the container and seal. Gently rotate until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Then add in the cornstarch to the container. Gently toss until well coated.</li>
        <li>You can fry this in a pan, but we recommend Air Frying for extra crispiness. Preheat air fryer to 400F, and then add the tofu in a single layer and cook for 10-12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through cooking time.</li>
        <li>Heat sesame oil in frying pan. Add minced ginger, crushed garlic, and red chili flakes to the pan until toasted, and then add your cooked tofu.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the tofu and flash fry for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Serve with basmati rice and chopped chives.</li>
      </ol>
